**Correlation of Income (GDP Proxy) with Tourist Arrivals in Medellín**

1.  **Pre-COVID Correlation**:
    *   **Moderate Impact**: Before the pandemic, the correlation between GDP and tourist arrivals was moderate (0.53). This suggests that while tourism contributed to economic growth in the sector, other factors (such as local economic activities and global events) influenced the income independently of tourism.
2.  **Post-COVID Correlation**:
    *   **High Sensitivity to Tourism**: Post-COVID, the correlation increases significantly to 0.94, reflecting that Medellín's accommodation and food services sector has become more reliant on tourism for revenue generation. This shift could be attributed to travel behavior changes and an increased focus on tourism during recovery.
