**Age-Based Analysis of Tourist Arrivals**

1.  **Pre-COVID Observations**:
    *   **Older Age Groups Lead**: Age groups 50-59, 60-69, and 70+ show moderate correlations (0.57-0.60), indicating a stable contribution to GDP.
    *   **Minimal Influence of Youth**: Ages 0-17 had the lowest correlation (0.23), suggesting a limited impact, likely due to their dependency on family travel.
2.  **Post-COVID Trends**:
    *   **High Correlation Across Ages**: All age groups, especially 0-17 (0.97), show increased correlations with GDP post-COVID. This implies a growing alignment between age-based tourism and economic recovery efforts.
