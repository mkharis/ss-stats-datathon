**Overall Analysis**

1.  **Dominance of "Turismo" (Tourism) and "Acto Administrativo" (Administrative Act):**
    *   **"Turismo" consistently leads** in terms of tourist numbers across the timeline, especially peaking in **2016** with around **237,822 visitors**. This highlights leisure and general tourism as the primary motivation for most travelers visiting Medellín.
    *   **"Acto Administrativo" also shows a significant peak around 2015-2016**, with over **200,000 visitors**. This surge suggests a temporary rise in travel for administrative reasons, possibly linked to events or policy shifts that necessitated in-person administrative attendance in Medellín.
2.  **Stability in Other Travel Purposes:**
    *   Travel categories like **"Negocios" (Business)**, **"Conferencia" (Conference)**, and **"Capacitación" (Training)** maintain relatively stable and lower levels across the years. These categories show minor fluctuations but lack notable peaks, indicating a consistent but smaller portion of the total tourism landscape in Medellín.
3.  **Impact of COVID-19 in 2020:**
    *   There is a significant drop in 2020 across nearly all travel purposes, directly corresponding with the **global COVID-19 pandemic**. Travel restrictions, health concerns, and lockdowns led to a severe reduction in tourism, particularly affecting non-essential and international travel purposes.

**Key Trends and Interesting Points**

1.  **2016 Peak in "Turismo" and "Acto Administrativo":**
    *   **High Influx of Tourists**: The peak in 2016 for both "Turismo" and "Acto Administrativo" suggests specific events or favorable conditions during that year attracted an exceptionally high number of visitors to Medellín.
    *   **Potential Drivers**: The surge could be attributed to major international events, diplomatic or policy changes, improved accessibility, or successful tourism campaigns. This temporary increase underscores the impact that strategic events and policies can have on tourist inflows.
2.  **Moderate Increase in "Negocios" (Business) Travel in 2016:**
    *   **Growth in Business Tourism**: "Negocios" saw an increase in 2016 with **38,074 visitors**, reflecting a growing interest in Medellín as a business hub. This rise could be linked to Medellín's economic growth, investment opportunities, or business events hosted in the city.
    *   **Implications**: Although smaller than the tourism and administrative peaks, this trend highlights Medellín's potential for attracting business-oriented travelers, suggesting an opportunity for growth in business tourism.
3.  **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact in 2020:**
    *   **Sharp Decline Across All Categories**: Every category shows a sharp decline in 2020, mirroring the global impact of the pandemic. The drop illustrates the heavy reliance of Medellín’s tourism on international and discretionary travel, both of which were disrupted by the pandemic.
    *   **Slow Recovery Post-2020**: Categories like "Turismo" and "Negocios" began a slow recovery after 2020, but numbers remain below the peaks of previous years. This gradual rebound highlights ongoing caution among travelers and the lingering effects of the pandemic on tourism.
4.  **Emerging Trend in "Residente" (Resident) Category in 2022:**
    *   **Rise in Long-Term Stays**: The category "Residente" shows an increase in 2022 with **18,748 tourists**, possibly indicating a shift toward extended stays. This could be driven by the rise of remote work, allowing people to spend extended periods in Medellín rather than short-term visits.
    *   **Potential for Digital Nomads and Long-Term Visitors**: Medellín’s attractiveness to digital nomads, retirees, and those seeking long-term stays post-pandemic is evident. The city’s favorable cost of living, climate, and infrastructure could make it a popular choice for long-term stays.
