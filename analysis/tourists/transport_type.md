2.  **Minimal Impact of Alternative Transportation Modes:**
    *   **Low and Stable Contributions**: River, maritime, and land travel make up a much smaller portion of total tourist arrivals, with each mode remaining relatively low and stable across the timeline. These modes cater to a smaller, likely regional audience and are **less affected by global trends**.

Notable points include the **2016 peak** and the **2020 pandemic-induced drop**, underscoring the sector’s reliance on air travel and sensitivity to external events.

**Key Trends and Interesting Points**

1.  **2016 Peak in Air Travel:**
    *   **Significant Surge**: Air travel reached its highest level in 2016, marking a unique peak in Medellín’s tourism influx. This year saw 327,928 air arrivals, the highest across the dataset.
    *   **Possible Drivers**: The peak may have been influenced by favorable policies, international events, or tourism campaigns. The growth could be attributed to efforts to promote Medellín as a destination, a surge in international awareness, or other temporary but impactful factors that encouraged foreign visitors to choose Medellín.
    *   **Temporary Nature**: The subsequent decline suggests that the factors behind the 2016 spike were short-lived, emphasizing the need for consistent promotional and strategic efforts.
2.  **Post-2016 Decline in Air Travel:**
    *   **Steady Drop**: After 2016, there is a gradual decline in air travel numbers, indicating that the factors leading to the 2016 peak were not sustained. By 2018, air travel had significantly reduced, underscoring a **need for ongoing tourism strategies** beyond one-time campaigns or events.
    *   **Implications for Strategic Planning**: This decline highlights Medellín's vulnerability to one-time events. Sustainable tourism requires long-term strategies that maintain visitor interest and attract diverse traveler demographics beyond temporary boosts.
3.  **Sharp Decline in 2020 Due to COVID-19 Pandemic:**
    *   **Pandemic Impact on All Modes**: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a **dramatic decline across all transportation modes** in 2020, with air travel seeing the most significant reduction. The sharp drop aligns with global lockdowns, travel restrictions, and heightened health concerns.
    *   **Vulnerability of Air Travel Dependency**: The heavy reliance on air travel exacerbated the impact of COVID-19 on Medellín’s tourism sector, demonstrating the risks of over-dependence on a single entry mode. This decline highlights the importance of resilience planning for the tourism industry.
4.  **Gradual Recovery Post-2020:**
    *   **Slow Rebound in Air Travel**: Starting in 2021, air travel numbers show a gradual recovery, though they remain well below the 2016 peak. The slow rebound reflects ongoing caution in the tourism sector, changing travel preferences, and lingering health concerns among travelers.
    *   **Stability in Other Modes**: Land, river, and maritime travel remain largely unchanged post-pandemic, indicating limited contribution to the recovery. The data suggests that these modes may not be prioritized by tourists or may lack sufficient infrastructure or promotion to drive significant tourism growth.
